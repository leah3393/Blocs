# Blocs - A simple iOS game

This is my first attempt at making a game without a tutorial. 
It has a few bugs that I'm working on, but it's mostly completed at this point.


Now on to the next challenge!


I'm uploading this code to Github for a few reasons:
    
1. I want to keep track of my games that I create
2. I want others to be able to look at it as an example (not that it's amazing or anything lol, but I did try my best!)

Note: The files are laid out nicely in Xcode (as in, they are in their correct folders and what not). Not quite sure why they didn't get laid out nicely in the actual files/folders, but I'm looking into it! (I probably just didn't check a box that I needed to)
